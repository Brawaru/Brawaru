### Hello, stranger! 👽

My name is Sasha... and that's all I've got, really.

Some uninteresting things about me:

- 🇷🇺 Sasha from Russia (*help*). My timezone is [UTC+7/KRAT](https://time.is/KRAT), but I'm mostly active during the nights!
- 🇺🇸 Terrible English speaker and [translator to Russian](https://crowdin.com/profile/Sasha-Sorokin). People tell this is not true, I don't believe them.
- ⚛️ Currently learning [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). Already know and use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- 🧊 Love Minecraft and sometimes experementing with plugins and mods. Some good ones [are open-sourced](https://github.com/Brawaru?tab=repositories&language=java).
- 🤹 Pronouns are [he/him](https://pronoun.is/he) or [they/them](https://pronoun.is/they/.../themselves).
- 🐦 I have [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@brawaru) and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@sasha_sorokin) accounts.
- 🙃 Boring and depressive, but trying my best. Sorry if I sound passive aggressive.
- 🍵 In case I helped you or your project, consider [donation](https://donate.stream/en/brawaru)*.

Nice to meet ya.
