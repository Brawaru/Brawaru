### Hello, stranger! 👽

My name is Sasha... and that's all I've got, really.

Some uninteresting things about me:

- 🇷🇺 Sasha from Russia (*help*). My timezone is [UTC+7/KRAT](https://time.is/KRAT).
- 🇺🇸 Bad English speaker and [translator to Russian](https://crowdin.com/profile/Sasha-Sorokin) (bad at this too).
- ⚛️ Currently learning [React](https://reactjs.org/) and already know and use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- 🤹 Pronouns are [he/him](https://pronoun.is/he) or [they/them](https://pronoun.is/they/.../themselves).
- 🐘 I have a [Mastodon page](https://mastodon.social/@sasha_sorokin), tons of shitposts!
- 🙃 I'm boring and depressive, but trying my best.
- 🍵 In case I helped you or your project, consider [donation](https://money.yandex.ru/to/410014746904198)*.

Nice to meet ya.
